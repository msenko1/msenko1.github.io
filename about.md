I am a 1st year PhD student in the [Stanford Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.stanford.edu/ "Stanford Linguistics"). My research is supported by an [EDGE Doctoral Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/EDGE "EDGE Doctoral Fellowship Program") from the Stanford Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education. My work lies at the intersection of variationist and computational sociolinguistics, exploring the cognitive dynamics underlying both within- and across-speaker variation in speech production.

My previous research focused on variation in the uptake of (pro)nominal forms on Twitter and in the stressed vowel of *CHICAGO*. I received a B.S./M.A. in Linguistics & Communication Studies from Northwestern University in 2022, where I worked with [Rob Voigt](https://robvoigt.faculty.ucdavis.edu/ "Rob's Webpage") and [Annette D'Onofrio](https://sites.northwestern.edu/donofrio/ "Annette's Webpage"). I worked as a teacher for three years prior to starting my PhD, first in Taiwan through the [Fulbright](https://www.fulbright.org.tw/ "Fulbright Taiwan") program and later in New York City.

Starting in Fall 2025, I will be a first year PhD student in the [Stanford Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.stanford.edu/ "Stanford Linguistics"). My research is supported by an [EDGE Doctoral Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/EDGE "EDGE Doctoral Fellowship Program") from the Stanford Office of the Vice Provost for Graduate Education.

I received a B.S./M.A. in Linguistics & Communication Studies from Northwestern University in 2022, where I worked with [Rob Voigt](https://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/robvoigt/ "Rob's Webpage") and [Annette D'Onofrio](https://sites.northwestern.edu/donofrio/ "Annette's Webpage"). Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a teacher first in Taiwan through the [Fulbright](https://www.fulbright.org.tw/ "Fulbright Taiwan") program and later in New York City at [Winston Prep](https://www.winstonprep.edu/our-campuses/new-york "Winston Prep") and [Collegiate School](https://www.collegiateschool.org "Collegiate School"). I have taught everything from TEFL and math to computer science and religion.

I'm broadly interested in how social and linguistic information is integrated. I use sociophonetic and computational methods in [my research](/research/) to shed light on the cognitive dynamics underlying language users' utilization and perception of variation. My previous work has focused on variation in the uptake of new (pro)nominal forms on Twitter and in the second vowel of Chicago.
